    <p>I have made this website using the following.In the provided HTML code, various HTML tags are utilized to structure the document, define content sections, apply styling, create links, tables, and headings for better organization and presentation of information.

        The `DOCTYPE html` tag declares the document type and version of HTML being used, ensuring proper rendering by web browsers. The `html lang="en"` tag defines the root element of the HTML document and specifies the language of the content, enhancing accessibility and SEO.
        
        Within the `head` section, essential meta-information is included. The `meta charset="utf-8"` tag specifies the character encoding for the document, ensuring proper display of characters. The `title` tag sets the title of the HTML document, which appears in the browser tab. Additionally, `link` tags are used to link external resources such as favicon and CSS stylesheet files.
        
        The `body` tag encloses the main content of the HTML document. Inside the `body`, `div` tags are used to create divisions or sections, providing a way to structure and style content. Inline CSS styling is applied using the `style` attribute within the `div` tags.
        
        Semantic tags like `nav`, `ul`, `li`, and 'a` are employed to create navigation menus with hyperlinks. The `ul` tag defines an unordered list, while 'li` represents list items within the list. Hyperlinks are created using the `<a>` tag, facilitating navigation to different sections or external pages.
        
        Heading tags such as `h1`, `h2`, and `h4` are used to define headings of varying importance, aiding in content organization and hierarchy. Additionally, the `center` tag is utilized to center-align content within sections.
        
        Tables are constructed using the `table`, `tr`, and `td` tags to display tabular data neatly. Attributes like `border`, `cellspacing`, and `bgcolor` are employed to customize the appearance of the table.
        
        Finally, the `footer` tag defines a footer section containing contact information or additional details. The `section` tag helps in structuring the content, making it easier to navigate. Unique identifiers (`id` attributes) are assigned to elements for targeted styling or linking within the document.
        
        Together, these HTML tags play a crucial role in organizing, styling, and presenting content within the HTML document, ensuring a cohesive and user-friendly web experience.</p>
